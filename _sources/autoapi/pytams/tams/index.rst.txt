.. py:data:: STALL_TOL
   :value: 1e-10


.. py:function:: parse_cl_args(a_args: list[str] | None = None) -> argparse.Namespace

   Parse provided list or default CL argv.

   :param a_args: optional list of options


.. py:class:: TAMS(fmodel_t: Any, a_args: list[str] | None = None)

   A class implementing TAMS.

   The interface to TAMS, implementing the main steps of
   the algorithm.

   Initialization of the TAMS class requires a forward model
   type which encapsulate all the model-specific code, and
   an optional list of options.

   The algorithm is roughly divided in two steps:
   1. Initialization of the trajectory ensemble
   2. Splitting iterations

   Separate control of the parallelism is provided for
   both steps.

   All the algorithm data are contained in the TAMS database.
   For control purposes, a walltime limit is also provided. It is
   passed to working and lead to the termination of the algorithm
   in a state that can be saved to disk and restarted at a later stage.

   :ivar _fmodel_t: the forward model type
   :ivar _parameters: the dictionary of parameters
   :ivar _wallTime: the walltime limit
   :ivar _startDate: the date the algorithm started
   :ivar _plot_diags: whether or not to plot diagnostics during splitting iterations
   :ivar _init_ensemble_only: whether or not to stop after initializing the trajectory ensemble
   :ivar _tdb: the trajectory database (containing all trajectories)



   .. py:method:: n_traj() -> int

      Return the number of trajectory used for TAMS.

      Note that this is the requested number of trajectory, not
      the current length of the trajectory ensemble.

      :returns: number of trajectory



   .. py:method:: elapsed_time() -> float

      Return the elapsed wallclock time.

      Since the initialization of the TAMS object [seconds].

      :returns: TAMS elapse time.

      :raises ValueError: if the start date is not set



   .. py:method:: remaining_walltime() -> float

      Return the remaining wallclock time.

      [seconds]

      :returns: TAMS remaining wall time.



   .. py:method:: out_of_time() -> bool

      Return true if insufficient walltime remains.

      Allows for 5% slack to allows time for workers to finish
      their work (especially with Dask+Slurm backend).

      :returns: boolean indicating wall time availability.



   .. py:method:: generate_trajectory_ensemble() -> None

      Schedule the generation of an ensemble of stochastic trajectories.

      Loop over all the trajectories in the database and schedule
      advancing them to either end time or convergence with the
      runner.

      The runner will use the number of workers specified in the
      input file under the runner section.

      :raises Error if the runner fails:



   .. py:method:: check_exit_splitting_loop(k: int) -> tuple[bool, numpy.typing.NDArray[numpy.number]]

      Check for exit criterion of the splitting loop.

      :param k: loop counter

      :returns: bool to trigger splitting loop break
                array of maximas across all trajectories



   .. py:method:: finish_ongoing_splitting() -> None

      Check and finish unfinished splitting iterations.

      If the run was interrupted during a splitting iteration,
      the branched trajectories might not have ended yet. In that case,
      a list of trajectories to finish is listed in the database.



   .. py:method:: get_restart_at_random(min_idx_list: list[int]) -> list[int]

      Get a list of trajectory index to restart from at random.

      Select trajectories to restart from among the ones not
      in min_idx_list.

      :param min_idx_list: list of trajectory index to restart from

      :returns: list of trajectory index to restart from



   .. py:method:: do_multilevel_splitting() -> None

      Schedule splitting of the initial ensemble of stochastic trajectories.

      Perform the multi-level splitting iterations, possibly restarting multiple
      trajectories at each iterations. All the trajectories in an iterations are
      advanced together, such that each iteration takes the maximum duration among
      the branched trajectories.

      If the walltime is exceeded, the splitting loop is stopped and ongoing
      trajectories are flagged in the database in order to finish them upon
      restart.

      The runner will use the number of workers specified in the
      input file under the runner section.

      :raises Error if the runner fails:



   .. py:method:: compute_probability() -> float

      Compute the probability using TAMS.

      :returns: the transition probability



   .. py:method:: get_database() -> pytams.database.Database

      Accessor to database.

      :returns: A reference to the database in use
